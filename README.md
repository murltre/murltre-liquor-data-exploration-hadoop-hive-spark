## Business Questions

1. **Stores & Categories Performance**  
   How do store volumes and product sales correlate with total dollar sales?

2. **Pricing Strategy**  
   How does pricing affect sales volume and profitability across categories?

3. **Vendor & Category Profitability**  
   Which vendors and products contribute most to profitability, and how can this inform inventory and negotiation strategies?

## Tools & Technologies

- **Apache Hadoop** (HDFS)
- **Apache Hive** (SQL-based querying)
- **Apache Spark** (Data processing & transformation)
- **Tableau** (Data visualization)
- **HiveQL / SQL**

## Data Processing Workflow

1. Loaded CSV dataset into Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS)
2. Processed data with **Apache Spark** to clean, format, and prepare for analysis
3. Queried datasets using **HiveQL** to compute key metrics
4. Visualized insights using **Tableau dashboards**

## Key Insights & Results

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Store & Category Performance
- **Hy-Vee #3 / Des Moines** and **Central City 2** led in total sales
- **Central City Liquor, Inc.** had a **high profitability ratio** of `$104.55 per gallon` on `$2.8M` revenue
- **Top Categories by Revenue**:
  - **American Vodkas**: `$65M` (highest sales)
- **Top Categories by Profitability**:
  - **Imported Brandies**: `$184 per gallon`
  - **100% Agave Tequila**: `$147.38 per gallon`



üí° *Recommendation*: Increase premium product stock in high-ratio stores (e.g., Central City, Urbandale) to improve margins.

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Pricing Strategy & Elasticity
- Calculated price elasticity using % change in quantity vs. price
- **High Elasticity Categories** (very price-sensitive):
  - American Cordials & Liqueurs, Coffee Liqueurs, RTD Cocktails
- **Low Elasticity Categories**: More stable in price

üí° *Recommendation*:  
  - **Lower prices** slightly for high-elasticity products to boost volume  
  - **Raise prices** for low-elasticity products without losing sales volume

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Vendor Profitability
- **Top Vendor**: **DIAGEO AMERICAS**
  - Dominant in **Canadian Whiskies** and **Spiced Rum**
- **Sazerac Company** showed balanced volume & profitability in Whiskey Liqueur

üí° *Recommendation*:  
  - Partner with DIAGEO for **joint promotions** and **exclusive access**  
  - Use **competitive pricing** to grow Sazerac sales volume
